        <li><h2>AMERICAN STANDARD ONE POCKET</h2></li>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Click to view detailed 1-pocket rules</button>
        <div class="content">
        <p>One Pocket title depicts the uniqueness of the game for it refers to only one pocket of the two foot pockets 
            as being used for a player or side as their designated scoring pocket, with the other foot pocket designated 
            to the opposing player or side as their scoring pocket. One Pocket is a non-call shot game played with a cue 
            ball and a full rack of 15 all legal object balls. The game starts by breaking the balls towards the breaker's 
            designated pocket with the intent of not leaving their opponent a shot at their own designated pocket, nor a 
            shot to knock the balls away from the breaker's designated pocket. This strategic maneuvering of keeping your 
            opponent from scoring while you score carries on throughout the game to accomplish scoring the required eight 
            balls in your designated pocket, for the win!</p>

        <p><u>The Game</u>: played by two players or sides with each taking one of the two foot pockets as their scoring 
            pocket. It is played with a fifteen-ball rack of all legal balls to score 8 balls in their designated scoring 
            pocket for the win.</p>

        <p><u>The Lag</u>: winner of the lag can break or pass, with the breaker selecting their scoring pocket.</p>

        <p><u>Rack and Break</u>: Standard: opponent racks; Vintage: breaker racks. With either rack a ball scored in the breaker's 
            pocket counts. Modern: breaker racks and a ball scored in their pocket is a re-rack unless a cue ball scratch 
            occurs; or played instead to re-rack whether a scratch occurs or not. The break is an alternating break format.</p>
    
        <p><u>The Break</u>: a rail can be contacted or not prior to contacting any racked ball, thereafter either a ball must be 
            pocketed or the cue ball or a ball must contact a rail, or it is a foul with the opponent accepting the table as 
            is. If the cue ball is illegally placed or illegally stroked or does not contact the rack of balls it is a -1pt. 
            foul, resulting in the opponent having the option of accepting the table as is or calling for a re-break. When the 
            breaker scratches it is -1pt., and the opponent receives the cue ball in hand behind the line.</p>

        <p><u>Scoring</u>: with each ball scored in your designated scoring pocket it is a +1 ball scored, and the inning continues. 
            A shooter pocketing a ball into the opponent's pocket, is scored, and if a ball is also scored in the shooter's 
            pocket, play continues. With each foul the score is a -1 ball.</p>

        <p><u>Fouls</u>: play is by cue ball foul only or it can be played by all ball fouls. On a pocket scratch or the cue ball 
            jumps off the table, it is a cue-ball-in-hand-behind-the-line foul, and any ball scored in either the opponent's 
            or the shooter's scoring pocket is spotted, plus another ball for the foul, unless owed. On other fouls, the cue 
            ball plays as it lies, and a ball scored in the opponent's pocket counts. When spotting a ball or pulling a ball 
            from a pocket, it is not a foul to disturb an object ball or the cue ball. A ball jumped off the table is a foul. 
            You are not allowed to play a jump shot with a jump cue. The 3 consecutive foul rule applies.</p>

        <p><u>Neutral Pocketed Ball</u>: is a ball pocketed in a pocket that is not a scoring pocket. It has no effect upon the inning 
            and is spotted at the end of an inning.</p>

        <p><u>Owed Balls</u>: when a foul occurs and no ball has been scored, then it is owed. Owed balls are marked up by the 
            offending player by placing a coin on the foot rail by their pocket. At the end of a scoring inning the owed ball is 
            spotted, and the coin is removed by the offending player.</p>

        <p><u>Forgotten Balls</u>: are balls that were not spotted at the appropriate time, and when remembered they are then spotted 
            after each player has had an inning.</p>

        <p><u>Spotting Balls</u>: balls are spotted by the outgoing player. When all balls are cleared off the table and the game has 
            yet to be won, then balls to be spotted are all spotted up at once, including forgotten balls and balls scored in 
            error into the wrong scoring pocket.</p>

        <p><u>Trap / Wedge</u>: with the use of an illegal push / double hit stroke or an illegal technique to trap the cue ball and or 
            a ball within the stack of balls it results in the opponent having the option to restore the balls, or if deemed 
            unrestorable then receives the option of ball in hand behind the line. When this happens within the jaws of the 
            pocket to wedge the cue ball and or a ball, then the opponent has the option to restore the balls or to receive ball 
            in hand behind the line.</p>

        <p><u>Scoring in Error into the Wrong Pocket</u>: if the shooter mistakenly shoots and scores in the opponent's pocket, then the 
            ball or balls on that initial shot, count. The opponent must then inform the shooter of their error. If the error 
            continues in that inning, and when once recognized then no other balls except the first ball(s) scored on the first 
            shot will count, and all other balls are spotted after the next player's inning. Balls scored in error in previous 
            innings will stay down. A game played in error to fruition, stands.</p>

        <p><u>Handicap Play</u>: when the opponent's playing skills vary, then the game can be played to a different score by each 
            player. When the total handicap score is greater than 16, then the opponent(s) going to a higher score than 8 would 
            then spot their first scoring balls at the end of the inning to get back to the standard game total ball count of 16. 
            When a shot scores the game winning ball in both the shooter's and opponent's scoring pocket, then the shooter wins 
            the game.</p>

        <p><u>Assumption Game is Over</u>: when the player at the table mistakenly assumes the game is won, and then intentionally 
            disturbs a ball or the cue ball, it is a foul resulting in the opponent's restoration option. When two or more balls, 
            or a ball and the cue ball are intentionally disturbed it is a loss of game. If the opponent approaches the table and 
            moves a ball or balls or does any other concession act, then it is an automatic loss of game.</p>
    
        <p><u>Knowing the Score</u>: players are responsible for handling their own scored balls, and coins for owed balls, and must know 
            their own score. Any score related omission by the opponent cannot be taken as definitive. The game is won when it is 
            acknowledged that a player has scored the game winning ball.</p>

        <p><u>Serious Fouls</u>: For three consecutive fouls, the penalty is loss of the current rack. For unsportsmanlike 
            conduct, the referee will choose a penalty appropriate given the nature of the offense.</p>
        
        <p><u>Stalemate</u>: If a stalemate occurs, all 15 balls will be reracked as for the start of 
            the game, and the players will lag to see who has the next shot. Any markers for owed balls will be preserved 
            and positive partial scores from the abandoned rack will be carried over to the rerack. (Those partial scores 
            should be written down as there will not be object balls to use as physical markers for them.)</p>

        </div>
        
        <li><h2>Bank Pool</h2></li>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Click to view detailed Bank Pool rules</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Bank pool is played with either nine or fifteen object balls and a cue ball. The player who scores the required number 
                of bank shots wins the rack. Matches are to a given number of racks.</p>

            <p><u>Determining the Break</u>: The player who wins the lag chooses who will break the first rack. 
                Subsequent breaking order is determined by tournament protocol.</p>
            
            <p><u>Rack at Bank Pool</u>: In short rack bank pool, nine balls are racked in a diamond shape as for nine 
                ball. The winning score is five. In full rack bank pool, fifteen balls are racked in a triangle shape as 
                for eight ball and the winning score is eight.</p>

            <p><u>Break Shot</u>: The cue ball is in hand behind the head string. On the break, if no object ball is 
                pocketed, at least four object balls must be driven to one or more rails. If the breaker fails to do this, 
                the break is illegal and the opponent may take the balls in position or require the breaker to break again. 
                If any ball is pocketed on a legal break, the breaker's turn continues.</p>

            <p><u>Continuing Play</u>: The shooter's turn continues until they fail to pocket a valid bank, foul, or the 
                rack is won by the shooter reaching the required score. The incoming player shoots from the position left 
                by the previous player except after a scratch when the cue ball is in hand behind the head string.</p>
            
            <p><u>Valid Bank Shots</u>: For a bank shot to be valid, the player must indicate the object ball, one or more 
                cushions in order that the ball will contact, and the pocket the object ball will go into. Incidental cushion 
                contacts on the two rail sections adjoining the target pocket as the ball enters the pocket are not counted as 
                cushion contacts for or against the shooter.</p>
            <p>In addition, the following requirements must be met. The cue ball must contact the called ball before it 
                contacts any other ball or any rail. The called ball must not contact any other object ball or the cue ball a 
                second time. The object ball must not contact uncalled rails except for the incidental contact mentioned above. 
                There must be no foul during the shot.</p>
            <p>If the cue ball contacts the called ball and either a cushion or another object ball at nearly the same time, 
                and it cannot be determined which was struck first, it will be assumed the called ball was struck first.</p>

            <p><u>Scoring</u>: Each valid bank shot counts one point for the shooter. Any additional ball pocketed on the 
                shot does not count and is spotted after the shooter's turn.</p>
            <p>If there is no score keeper or other scoring system, it is recommended that the score be kept as follows. 
                The balls scored by each player are used as physical markers for the score in two corresponding storage 
                locations. When a foul occurs, one of the fouler's scored balls is spotted as the one-point penalty in 
                addition to any other balls that need to be spotted at that time. If a player has no ball to spot for a 
                foul, a marker is placed to indicate a ball is owed. If the player later scores balls, they are spotted to 
                cancel any owed balls.</p>
            
            <p><u>Spotting Balls</u>: Balls are spotted if they have been pocketed other than as a valid bank or are driven 
                off the table. Balls are also spotted as a penalty for a foul or to pay for previous fouls (owed balls) as 
                described above.
            <p>Spotting is usually done at the end of the shooter's turn, but if the shooter clears the table and has not 
                reached the required score, all balls to be spotted are spotted at that time and the shooter continues 
                shooting.</p>
            
            <p><u>Forgetting to Spot Balls</u>: If a ball is not spotted when it should be and is later noticed, it will 
                normally be spotted when each player has had one full turn after the discovery. Alternatively, if both 
                players agree, the ball will be spotted immediately.</p>

            <p><u>Standard Fouls</u>: Standard fouls are penalized by the loss of one point, balls are spotted as necessary, 
                and play passes to the opponent. The cue ball remains in position except as noted below. The cue ball 
                remains in position except as noted below.</p>
            <p>The following are standard fouls at Bank Pool:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cue Ball Scratch or off the Table. The cue ball is in hand behind the head string.</li>
                    <li>No Rail after Contact</li>
                    <li>No Foot on Floor</li>
                    <li>Ball Driven off the Table</li>
                    <li>Touched Ball</li>
                    <li>Double Hit / Frozen Balls</li>
                    <li>Push Shot</li>
                    <li>Balls Still Moving</li>
                    <li>Bad Cue Ball Placement</li>
                    <li>Bad Play from Behind the Head String</li>
                    <li>Cue Stick on the Table</li>
                    <li>Playing out of Turn</li>
                    <li>Slow Play</li>
                </ul>
